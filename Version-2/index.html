		<h2><u>Boids Algorithm</u></h2>
		<h3>Version 2</h3>
		<p>This version of the algorithm has fixed the clumping issue. This was achieved by weighting the three forces (seperation, alignment, and cohesion), and then giving the seperation force a higher weight than the other two forces. This results in a far more natural looking flocking effect.</p>
		<p><i>This version of the algorithm isn't commented, however the main changes are inside the flock() function.</i></p>
