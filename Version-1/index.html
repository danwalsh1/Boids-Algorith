		<h2><u>Boids Algorithm</u></h2>
		<h3>Version 1</h3>
		<p>This version is the initial version I'm using of Boids algorithm. It is extremely similar to the one found online (as mentioned on the contents page), however I have added comments to explain what is going on throughout the code and to allow better understanding of why certain calculations are made.</p>
		<p>This version of the algorithm does seem to suffer from clumping, which indicated that the seperation force isn't strong enough. This is fixed in version 2.</p>
